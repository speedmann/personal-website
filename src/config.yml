    content: |-
      I'm an infrastructure architect with over a decade of experience in creating high available and resilient infrastructure.
      I live Infrastructure as Code with a great passion. Learning new things is what motivates me and finally solving a difficult problem is satisfaction.
      Always giving my best is mandatory but I also understand when it's time to be pragmatic. Often times done is better than perfect.

          After i finished my apprenticeship at METRO SYSTEMS I worked at they linux system administration department and was responsible for maintaining and designing their server infrastructure. Managing HP Bladecenters was as much part of this job as automating the installation of Red Hat Linux systems.

          During my time at METRO SYSTEMS I was given the chance to be part of their SAP insourcing, being responsible to supply hundreds of SUSE Linux for SAP VMs and blades to othe project members.

          My final steps at METRO SYSTEMS involved designing their on premise OpenStack cloud environments. Starting from ground up I designed their first environment using SUSE Cloud 5. After SUSE decided to deprecate their cloud offerings, we switched to using [OpenStack ansible](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/latest/#) to set up multiple installations around the globe.
